# Simple Todo Application in React.js & Redux

*I created this simple application while learning redux; particularly react-redux library.*

## Brief description of project:

- This is a simple todo application built in React.js & using Redux for state management.

## Just front-end :

- Since my focus while creating this project was learning React.js and Redux, I just made this application without saving todos/tasks in database. The tasks/todos are just saved in Redux store.
- Hence once the browser web page is refreshed, the added todos/tasks are lost.
- *This application has basic features and can be extended to include more features like creating back-end APIs for storing the tasks/todos in database instead of in Redux store for current scenario.*

## Functionalities included in project:

1. User can add new tasks/todos.
2. User can filter tasks/todos - All, Done, Not done.
3. User can toggle task status like from Done to Not done or viceversa


## Tools and technologies :

- React.js - JavaScript library for building UI

- react-bootstrap - JS library for bootstrap
- redux - predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- react-redux - React bindings for redux
- Firebase Hosting - for deployment of React.js app
- Sublime Text Editor - for writing code
- Git - for version control
